Quantifiers are used to make repeating matches in a certain order.

Quantifiers have three properties, a minimum, maximum and mode.

There are three modes:
    - Greedy: match as many as possible and backtrack if matches fail
    - Reluctant: match as few as possible and only increase if the match fails
    - Possessive: match as many as possible with no backtracking.

A quantifier is said to be single if both its minimum and maximum are 1.
A quantifier is said to be empty if its maximum (and also its minimum) is zero


The mode of a quantifier affects the order in which matches are attempted to be made.
Using the following pattern (1|2) with a minimum and maximum of 0 and 2 (respectively) is attempted to be matched in the following orders :
Greedy:    1 1, 1 2, 1, 2 1, 2 2, 2, Nothing
Reluctant: Nothing, 1, 1 1, 1 2, 2, 2 1, 2 2
Possessive: 1 1 (no further attempts)
